# Secretary: A command line program to help automatically reorganise your files
#
# Configuration is done by editing/creating a configuration file 
# using "secretary new". If you want everything stored at somewhere other than
# ~/.secretary, then edit "CONF_DIR" below.
#
# Please review the generated operation file before telling it to copy/move
# your files. You could potentially do a lot of damage to your system otherwise!
